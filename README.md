# Inferential_Statistics
In this analysis, we explore the General Social Survey Dataset. The General Social Survey has been used to monitor change and studying the growing complexity of American society since 1972. It is used to analyze data on contemporary American society to explain trends in attitudes, behaviors and functioning of American society. We select a few key variables of interests in this dataset. We decided to measure changes in metrics largely pertaining to religion and education and we tracked changes in these metrics from 1972 to 2013. These variables were interesting because the American perspective on religion has changed over the past 5 decades, and immigration has lead to the rise of new religioyus denominations such as Hindus, Orthodox Christian and Muslims. We are interested in education because the rise of technology has lead to an increase in demand of college education as well graduate degrees so we would like to see how education levls have changed overtime. We explore this data by creating line graphs and stacked bar charts and then conduct.
